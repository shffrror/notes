### Chapter One
* **Core Domain** - The core subdomain is the area of your product that will be the
difference between it being a success and it being a failure. Its the product's
unique selling point, the reason it is being built rather than bought...It is
vital that all of the team understand what the core domain is.

* **Ubiqiutous language** - A common, rigorisly defined language defined by the
  team as a whole that prevents ambiguity and allows precise communication. Can
  be used to update domain models. https://archfirst.org/domain-driven-design-2-ubiquitous-language/

* Create separate models for each subdomain.

* A ubiquitous language is used to help a development team and domain experts
  communicate, developing this working language to aide in communication _is the
  process of DDD_ "code is the artifact".

* DDD values a focus on the core domain, collaboration, and exploration with
  domain experts, experimentation to produce a more useful model, and an
  understanding of the various contexts in play in a complex problem domain.
  DDD is not a patterns language, it is a collaboration philosophy focused on
  delivery, with communication playing a central role.
